# Portfolio Website

This is the code repository for my personal portfolio website. It showcases my work as a web developer, including various projects and skills.

## Overview

The website is built using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design and additionally styled using SCSS. JavaScript is used for interactive elements and form handling. The site is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Features

- Responsive design
- Interactive elements with JavaScript
- Netlify form handling for contact submissions

## Local Development

To work on the project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run `gulp` to start the development server.

## Deployment

The `main` branch is automatically deployed to Netlify upon push. For more information about deployment processes, refer to the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/).
